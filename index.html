<h2>Screening questions?</h2>
<p> What's my biggest strength? <br>
    what's my biggest weakness?<br>
    A time when I failed :( <br>
    My proudest moment <br>
    How do I deal with difficult people? <br>
    What makes a strong leader? <br>
    Why do I like working with technology? <br>
    How good at scripting am I? <br>

<h2>Culture fit?</h2>
<p> I only ask for help if I have exhausted all options to find the answer myself <br>
I take a lot of notes <br>
I always assume good intentions <br>
I am not afraid to share my oppinion (nicely!), and my ego doesn't get damaged if you disagree with me<br>
I am a nerd but I also like to keep fit and I enjoy sports <br>
